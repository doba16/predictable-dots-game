        <h1>Predictable Dots Game</h1>

        <p>
            This project is similar to mobile games as Two Dots or Dots but you can specify which dots will appear.
        </p>

        <h2>Motivation</h2>

        <p>
            For giving a talk about <a href="https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2016/5883/" target="_blank">NP-completeness of Two Dots</a>
            I needed a version of Two Dots where I can specify which dots will appear.
            So I created Dots Game, where I can exactly specify the dimensions of the grid and the color of all dots.
        </p>

        <h2>Example</h2>

        <p>
            This is a live example of Dots Game. Move your mouse over the colored dots and click and drag to connect dots.
            This one is fully random and has no goals to be fulfilled. This means that you will always win the game.

            Open in full screen: <a href="examples/simple-example.html">Click here</a>
        </p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>

        <p>
            To add a bit more of a challenge you can set goals the player has to fulfill. Then you need to collect
            the specified amount of colored dots to win. If there are no moves left and the goals are not fulfilled,
            you lose the round.
